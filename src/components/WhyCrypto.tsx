              This is where vibe coding meets web3. Where the power of play becomes real, 
              and building at the speed of intuition isn't just a dream—it's how we work.

            <p>
              In today's games, when servers shut down, your items disappear forever. 
              Your creations, your characters, your entire digital identity—gone. 
              But we're building something different.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-primary/90 py-4">
              True ownership. Real play.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              With blockchain, you own your creations in a way that no company can revoke. 
              Not locked in a database somewhere, but living on a decentralized network. 
              Your characters get NFT birth certificates—proof they belong to you, forever.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We're dreaming out loud. Building in public. Creating an arcade where your imagination 
              has a permanent home, and every game you build adds to a universe that can't be deleted.
            </p>
