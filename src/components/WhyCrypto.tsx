            In today's games, when servers shut down, your items disappear forever. 
            Your hard-earned achievements, your favorite characters, your entire digital identity—gone.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But what if your character could live across multiple games, building a reputation that travels with you? 
            What if the sword you earned in one world could become a legend in another?
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-primary/90 py-4">
            That's the promise of true ownership.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            With blockchain technology, you own your creations in a way that no company can revoke. 
            Your characters, your items, your legacy—they're yours. Not locked in a company's database, 
            but living on a decentralized network that belongs to everyone and no one.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Every character you create gets an NFT birth certificate. It's not just a receipt—it's proof 
            that this digital being belongs to you, forever. Ready to explore new worlds, build new stories, 
            and become part of gaming history.
