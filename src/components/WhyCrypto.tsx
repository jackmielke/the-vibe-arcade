              <div className="space-y-4">
                <p>Because the world is built from systems, encoded by our ideas.</p>
                
                <p>
                  For decades, only programmers could shape those systems. They spoke the language of machines, 
                  and everyone else just lived inside their worlds.
                </p>
                
                <p>But now, we can speak to our computers — and they can understand us.</p>
                
                <p>
                  With AI as our translator, and the acceleration of powerful new tools, we can finally build 
                  at the speed of intuition — designing apps, games, and experiences by simply expressing ideas.
                </p>
                
                <p className="font-semibold text-primary/90">Everyone is a builder.</p>
                
                <p>
                  We're not just coding new tools. We're defining the physics of our digital universe — together.

                And with Web3 — we can <span className="italic">own</span> what we create.

                <p>
                  The old internet was a playground built on borrowed land. Our data, our art, our identities — 
                  all hosted somewhere else, subject to deletion, control, or profit by others.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Web3 changes that. It gives us permanence. It gives us provenance. It gives our creations a home.
                </p>
                
                <p>Now, when you build, it's yours.</p>
                
                <p>When we build together, it's <span className="italic font-semibold">ours.</span></p>
                
                <p>
                  With this arcade of the future, blockchains can serve as proof of authorship, collaboration, 
                  and community. Each new creation expands a shared universe that belongs to everyone who contributes to it.
                </p>
                
                <p>This is what happens when <strong>AI meets ownership.</strong></p>
                
                <p>When <strong>creativity meets protocol.</strong></p>
                
                <p>With <strong>the power of play.</strong></p>

                  Welcome to the new paradigm — where vibe coding meets Web3, and creation itself becomes a network.
